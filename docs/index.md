## **Project Overview**

The articles in my thesis fall into 3 main categories:

1. **Review, conceptual, and technical commentary articles:** <br>
   - How can/should AI from a technical perspective be applied within advertising?  
      Examining methodologies and frameworks for effective implementation.  
   - What consequences does AI have on business models, consumers, and societal implications?  
      How should marketers choose strategies?

2. **User experiments with human participants:** <br>
   - How do factors such as the surrounding media context influence how online ads are perceived?

3. **NLP empirical articles:** <br>
   NLP-techniques/systems for understanding media contexts that can be leveraged by advertisers and others. Specifically:  
      - Using LLMs to extract dynamic aspect-sentiment pairs in online reviews.  
      - Showing its application within opinion search and for creating a broad picture of consumers' opinions on products.

Together these works create insights on:  
- (i) How AI-driven contextual advertising can be implemented technically using methods such as NLP.  
- (ii) How media contexts influence how ads are perceived.  
- (iii) The societal and consumer implications when AI decides who marketing messages are targeted to.
