abstract: "We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by adding an LLM preprocessing step to the traditional topic-modeling pipeline. This step segments reviews into opinion units — distinct opinions with relevant text excerpts and sentiment scores. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system’s implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment modalities for accurate star-rating prediction"
