abstract: "

We propose a novel approach to extracting insights from customer reviews by integrating topic modeling with a preprocessing stage that employs large language models (LLMs). This preprocessing step breaks down reviews into opinion units— distinct opinions contetexualized by relevant text excerpts and sentiment ratings. Topic modeling using opinion units provides a comprehensive understanding of customer opinions, capturing the topics consumers are satisfied or concerned with and the intensity of their sentiments. By correlating these topics with business metrics, such as star ratings of reviews, we can gain insights on how specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We compare supervised and semi-supervised topic modeling techniques for clustering opinion units and evaluate their performance, discussing their strengths, limitations, and appropriate use cases. The use of opinion units addresses key challenges in prior work, particularly by isolating individual opinions within reviews. Our approach also enhances the interpretability of results, making it clearer which sections of raw text influenced clustering or regression outcomes.
