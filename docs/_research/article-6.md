abstract: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of programmatic digital marketing. This article provides a forward-looking perspective on AI in advertising and offers a conceptual framework for developing effective marketing strategies. We explore key developments in the industry: the progression from personalized to contextual targeting, and the increased reliance on AI-based automation. Additionally, the article identifies three critical factors – results, resources, and rectitude – that influence the choice of strategies for online advertisers. Our findings suggest that while AI might multiply the effectiveness of programmatic advertising campaigns, it comes with important tradeoffs that must be taken into account. By synthesizing literature from digital advertising, computer science, and media studies, we offer an improved understanding of the evolving programmatic advertising ecosystem and distill this into practical advice for advertisers."
