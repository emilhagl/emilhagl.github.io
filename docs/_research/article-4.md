abstract: "This article contributes to research on media-context effects by studying how ads are assessed when
positioned alongside news articles that evoke negative emotions in readers. We find that in general, negative
emotion does not influence advertising evaluation. Contrary to industry claims, the perceived source credibility
of the news site is not found to moderate the effects of negative content. However, on its own, the credibility
of the news site improves ad evaluations. Furthermore, high applicability between article and ad can enhance
ad recognition and produce a weak negative effect on attitudes towards ads and brands. Our results provide
evidence against the industry practice of avoiding negative news due to concerns over spill-over effects.
Marketers should focus advertising to credible news sites and, when appropriate, avoid negative articles with
high applicability to the advertised product and brand."
