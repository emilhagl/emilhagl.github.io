abstract: "Due to limitations on the use of third-party cookies as well as privacy and ethical concerns from using personal data for online advertising, many advertisers are compelled to explore alternative strategies. Contextual advertising has emerged as a viable alternative to sustain relevance. We study the underlying mechanisms behind personalized and contextual advertising effects on consumption intentions and ad recall using an online controlled experiment, survey questions, and structural equation modelling. Our study advances existing research on contextual effects by disentangling the influence of ad-context congruence and context involvement. We showcase how consumers’ involvement in contexts serves as an indicator for consumer interest in specific topics, which can be leveraged by contextual advertisements for improved consumption intentions. In contrast to previous research which we contend does not properly account for context involvement, we find no ain effect of ad-context congruence on intention. Regarding ad recall, we show that engaging context reduces recall of adjacent ads and that ad-context congruence increases the likelihood that ads go entirely unnoticed. For advertisers, our findings underscore the importance of personal relevance for advertising effectiveness. Furthermore, they suggest that placing ads in deliberately selected contexts is beneficial, as positive content attitudes spill over to consumption intentions."
